##Object detection##

1. Creating machine learning models which are capable of identifying
and localizing multiple objects in a single image remained a core challenge in computer vision

2. Tensorflow's object detection API is an open source framework
built on top of Tensorflow that makes it easy to construct, train
and deploy obect detection models

3. Object detection: 
It is the process of finding real-world object
instances like car, bike, TV, flowers, humans in still images or videos.
It allows for the recognition, localization, and detection of multiple
objects within an image. 
It is used in application such as image retrieval,
security, survelliance and advanced driver assistance systems.

4. Different ways of doing object detection:
* Feature based object detection
* Viola jones object detection
* SVM classification with HOG features
* Deep learning object detection
